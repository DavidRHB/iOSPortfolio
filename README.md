# iOSPortfolio

This repository contains a collection of Swift projects I've developed while learning and practicing iOS development. Each project showcases different concepts and skills, such as UI design, data persistence, data management, networking, and integration of Apple Frameworks.

## Projects

### PrettyPrint

An app that fetches and displays user data from an online database of randomly-generated people, including a list of users and their friends. It uses URLSession for network requests and Codable for JSON parsing, with features for offline data storage using the "SwiftData" Framework.

### RockPaperScissors

A simple game/brain-training app that allows you to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The app tracks the user score and provides an interactive user interface.

### SnowSeeker
